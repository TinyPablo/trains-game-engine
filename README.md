# Train Game Engine

This project is a Python-based implementation of the board game **Ticket to Ride: Europe**. 

The idea started as a personal challenge to better understand the game's mechanics after playing many sessions with my family. The goal is to build a working engine and eventually an algorithm to explore different strategies.

## Project Status
- **Current Phase:** Planning & Brainstorming.
- **Goal:** Create a game logic validator and a simple bot.

*Note: This is an early-stage project. Features and architecture are subject to change as the logic is implemented.*
